# RSA JWT Key Pair Generator

A Node.js script for generating RSA key pairs asynchronously and demonstrating their use with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This script enables secure token generation and verification by leveraging RSA public/private key cryptography.

## Features

- Generates RSA key pairs with configurable key sizes.
- Saves keys in PEM format (`.pem`) for cryptographic protocols.
- Encodes keys in Base64 and saves them as `.txt` files.
- Demonstrates integration with JWT for secure token signing and verification.
- Includes error handling for reliable execution.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Usage

### Generating RSA Keys

1. Run the script to generate RSA keys:
   ```bash
   node key-jwt.js
   ```

2. Upon execution, the following files will be generated in the project root:
   - `public-key.pem`: Public key in PEM format.
   - `private-key.pem`: Private key in PEM format.
   - `public-key-base64.txt`: Public key encoded in Base64.
   - `private-key-base64.txt`: Private key encoded in Base64.

### Using RSA Keys with JWT

The RSA key pairs generated by this script are ideal for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Here's a brief explanation:

- **Signing JWTs**: Use the private key to sign JWTs. This ensures that only the holder of the private key can create valid tokens.
- **Verifying JWTs**: Use the public key to verify the authenticity of the JWT. This ensures that the token was signed by the corresponding private key and has not been tampered with.

### Customizing Key Size

You can modify the `keySize` variable in the `key-jwt.js` file to change the RSA key size. The default size is `2048` bits.

```javascript
const keySize = 2048; // Change this value to your desired key size
```

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling to manage issues during key generation or file writing. Check the console output for error messages if something goes wrong.
